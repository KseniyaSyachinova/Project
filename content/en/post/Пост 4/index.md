## My impressions.

- The Moscow Zoo is one of the oldest in Europe. In terms of the size of the collection, it ranks 4th among European zoos and is among the top ten zoos in the world with the most extensive collections.

- The Moscow Zoo and its branches keep and breed the rarest species of animals - from Amur leopards and Trans-Baikal manuls to crocodile shinizaurs and Zagros newts. In addition, the zoo has a unique collection of venomous snakes that has no analogues in the world.

- It was very interesting and informative, but it is really a pity to see some animals in cages.
