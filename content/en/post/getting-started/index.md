## My impressions.

 - It was a truly long-awaited trip to my city. After the New Year holidays, I did not have the opportunity to come to Lebedyan. And now, after 3 months, I was able to get there. The meeting with relatives was very warm!
 - I finally saw my friends with whom we had a great time.
 - In addition, I really missed my pet. This is York, you can see it in the photo :)

I love walking around my city. Huge fields are a feature of my city. In May, everything begins to bloom and bloom, and this cannot but rejoice me. Although my city is small and sometimes a little boring, I love its nature.
Unfortunately, the time always comes to part, but I know that in the summer I will definitely come to my city, to my loved ones!
