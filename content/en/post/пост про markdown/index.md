## Useful information.

 - Most recently, I got acquainted with the markup language Markdown. I want to share with you information that may be useful to you.
Markdown is a simple markup language used to create rich text (such as HTML) with a text editor. It allows you to add basic formatting to text using characters known and available on all keyboards. Font size, color, and other advanced options are not available in Markdown.

## Why is it needed?
 - To add markup where no real markup is possible. For example, in a simple text file or in the same SMS, where it is impossible to bold, create headings, highlight quotes, etc.
 - For more convenient writing of texts for subsequent conversion to HTML or other formats.

You can familiarize yourself with the syntax of this language at the link: [**Introduction to the syntax of the language**](https://guides.hexlet.io/en/markdown/)
