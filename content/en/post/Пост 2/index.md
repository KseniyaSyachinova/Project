## My impressions.

  - This week my friend and I went to the "Multimedia Art Museum". This is not quite the usual museum that we are used to seeing. Sometimes incomprehensible and strange specimens were presented on it.
  - Can you imagine a trampoline in a museum where you can jump? To be honest, I didn’t and didn’t understand the author’s intentions.
  - What about a device that simulates lightning that occurs in real time?

I will remember this tour for a long time! I advise everyone to go to this exhibition. Hurry, it will close soon.
