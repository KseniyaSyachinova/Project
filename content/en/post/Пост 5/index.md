## My impressions.

Gravity Falls is an American animated television series created by Alex Hirsch and Disney Television Animation for Disney Channel and Disney XD.

The animated series tells about the adventures of twins - the boy Dipper and the girl Mabel, who spend their summer holidays with great-uncle Stan in a fictional American town called Gravity Falls.

It premiered on June 15, 2012 on Disney Channel. On June 14, 2014, it was announced that the second season would premiere on August 1 and 4, 2014 on Disney Channel and Disney XD, respectively. On November 20, 2015, Alex Hirsch stated that the series would end with its second season. The final episode of the second season, "Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back Gravity Falls", aired on February 15, 2016. On his Twitter, the creator of the animated series, Alex Hirsch, announced an addition to the series in the form of a comic book.

main characters

  - Dipper Pines is a 12-year-old boy, Mabel's twin brother, who came to Gravity Falls for the summer holidays. Always wears a cap. I came to Gravity Falls for the summer and found a mysterious diary there. Dreams of finding the author of diaries. In love with Wendy.
  - Mabel Pines is a 12-year-old girl, Dipper's twin sister. Kind and cheerful. He loves his piggy Waddles. Wears various sweaters.
  - Stanley "Uncle Stan" Pines is Dipper and Mabel's great-uncle whom they call Uncle. Owner of the Mystery Shack.
  - Zus Ramirez - 22-year-old master and permanent employee of the "Shack of Miracles"; good friend of Dipper and Mabel. Likes to eat delicious food. Fact: in the Russian dubbing, the name of Susa was renamed to Zus, indicating godlikeness.
  - Wendy Corduroy - 15-year-old red-haired girl, employee of the "Mystery Shack". Dipper's crush.
  - Stanford Pines is the missing twin brother of Stanley Pines, great uncle of Dipper and Mabel. Scientist and diarist.
  - Bill Cipher - an ancient powerful demon from another plane of existence, who wants to penetrate the human world. The main antagonist of the series.
  
  Gravity Falls is the quintessence of mysticism, humor, friendship and adventure! I can rewatch this series many times, because every time it is again interesting and fun. The family also adds a note to the series, which makes it even warmer. Uncle Stan is such a convex image, when I see him, I immediately remember my own dad. Perhaps this is due to the attitude to everything and the desire to earn money. One goal, so to speak. At the same time, the series unobtrusively broadcasts family values, support and love.
