## Theory.

A programming language is a formalized language designed to describe programs and algorithms for solving problems on a computer. Programming languages ​​are artificial. Their syntax and semantics are strictly defined. Therefore, they do not allow free interpretation of the expression, which is typical for natural language. Programming languages ​​fall into two main categories high-level languages ​​and low-level languages:

- High-level language [high-level language] - A programming language, the means of which provide a description of the problem in a visual, easily perceived form, convenient for the programmer. It does not depend on the internal machine codes of any type of computer, so programs written in high-level languages ​​require translation into machine codes by translator or interpreter programs. High-level languages ​​include Fortran, PL / 1, BASIC, Pascal, C, Ada, etc.

- Low-level language, [low-level language] - A programming language designed for a particular type of computer and reflecting its internal machine code (see also “machine language”, “machine-oriented language” and “assembler language” below).

There are also the following types of programming languages:

- Algorithmic language [algorithmic language] - A set of symbols, conventions and rules used to unambiguously describe algorithms and is usually part of a programming language;

- Nonalgorithmic language [nonalgorithmic language] - A programming language, the texts of which do not contain instructions on the order of operations and serve only as source material for the synthesis of an algorithm for solving a problem;

- Formal language [formal language] - a programming language built according to the rules of some logical calculus or formal grammar [formal grammar], which is a system of rules for constructing finite sign sequences in a given alphabet, the set of which forms a formal language;


- Source language - the programming language in which the program is written, as opposed to the machine language in which programs are executed by the computer. Source languages ​​are classified into high level languages ​​and low level languages.

- Machine (absolute) language, computer language [computer (machine) language] - A programming language designed to represent programs in a form that makes it possible to execute them by technical means;

- Machine-dependent (machine-oriented) language, machine-dependent programming language [computer-sensitive (computer-oriented) language] - A programming language that takes into account the structure and characteristics of a computer of a certain type or a specific computer;

- Machine-independent language [machine-independent language] - A programming language whose structure and means are not associated with any particular computer and allow you to execute programs compiled on it on any computer equipped with translators (see below) from this language;

- Symbolic language, symbolic coding language [symbolic language] - A programming language focused on specific computers and based on encoding machine operations using a specific set of characters;

- Hybrid (combined) language [hybrid language] - A programming language that also uses the means of another language;

- Graphic language [graphic language] - A language designed for writing computer graphics programs and using them.

- Base language [base language] –

- Machine language, common to the family of computers;

- Programming language in DBMS with offline language.

- Common language [common language] - Machine language common to a group of computers and external devices used by them;

- Reference language [reference language] - The language that is the basis for all its specific versions, which are options for adapting the reference language to certain conditions of use and purpose;

- Assembly language, assembler [assembler language] - Universal programming language, belonging to the category of low-level languages, the structure of which is determined by command formats, machine language data and computer architecture. It is used by programmers in cases where it is impossible to use a high-level language or efficient programs in machine codes are required.

- Declarative (non-procedural) language [declararative (nonprocedural) language] - A programming language that allows you to set connections and relationships between objects and quantities, but does not determine the sequence of actions (for example, Prolog languages, QBE);

- Imperative (procedural) language [imperative language] - A programming language that allows you to explicitly (by specifying executable operators) determine the actions and the order (sequence) of their execution;

- Functional programming language, functional language [functional language] - A declarative programming language based on the concept of functions that define a dependency but do not determine the order of evaluation.

- Specialized language [special language] - A programming language focused on solving a certain range of problems;

- Page Description Language [PDL - Page Description Language] - A specialized language designed for printing devices. Provides the ability to use images in a format that is independent of the settings of the display device. The best known language of this type is PostScript.

- Autonomous language [freestanding language] - Specialized high-level language, in closed DBMS ("DBMS with autonomous language");

- Language for designing interactive technologies - In DBMS - a language designed to describe the technological processes of data processing, taking into account the separation of the nature of operations by their types, as well as providing a dialogue with the system administrator;

- Data Manipulation Language, JMD [DML - Data Manipulation Language] - In a DBMS - a language designed to access a database and perform searches, reading and modifying its records;

- Language of processing lists [list language] - A specialized language designed to describe the processes of processing data presented in the form of lists of objects;

- Data description language [DDL - Data Description Language] - A language designed to describe the "conceptual schema" of the database;

- Data Storage Description Language [DSDL - Data Storage Description Language] - A language designed to describe the physical structure (schema) of a database;

- Page description language [page description language] A system for encoding documents that accurately describes their appearance after preparation for printing or display. An example of such a language is PDF (Portable Document Format), developed by Adobe for storing and presenting page images.

- Knowledge Representation Language [KRL - Knowledge Representation Language] - Declarative or declarative-procedural language designed to represent knowledge in computer memory (for example, Lisp and Prolog languages);

- Publication language [publication language] - The language used to publish algorithms and programs;

- Specification language [specification language] - Declarative language for specifying program specifications;

- Problem-oriented language [problem-oriented language] - A programming language designed to solve a certain class of tasks (problems);

- Procedural (procedure-oriented) language [procedure-orinted language] - A problem-oriented language that facilitates the expression of a procedure as an exact algorithm;

- Real-time language [real-time language] - A language used for programming tasks in which the reaction time of the computer is critical.


Developments and names of programming languages

- Ada [Ada] - A high-level programming language oriented to real-time systems and designed to automate the tasks of managing processes and / or devices, for example, in on-board (ship, aviation, etc.) computers. Developed at the initiative of the US Department of Defense in the 1980s. Named after the English mathematician Ada Augusta Byron (Lovelace), who lived from 1815-1851.

- Algol [ALGOL - ALGOrithmic Language] - A high-level programming language focused on the description of algorithms for solving computational problems. It was created in 1958 by specialists from Western European countries for scientific research. The Algol-60 version of this language was adopted by the International Conference in Paris (1960) and was widely used on computers of the 2nd generation. The Algol-68 version, developed by a group of specialists from the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) in 1968, received the status of an international universal programming language focused on solving not only computational, but also informational problems. Although Algol is hardly used at present, it served as a basis or had a significant influence on the development of more modern languages, for example, Ada, Pascal, etc.

- BASIC [BASIC - Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code] - High-level programming language, developed in 1963 - 1964. at Dartmouth College by Thomas Kurt and John Kemeny. Originally intended for teaching programming. It is simple, easy to learn by novice programmers due to the presence of simplified Fortran language constructs and built-in mathematical functions, algorithms and operators. There are many different versions of BASIC that are not fully compatible with each other. Some BASIC implementations include facilities for handling data and datasets. Most versions of BASIC use an interpreter that converts its components into machine code and allows you to run programs without an intermediate translation. Some more advanced versions of BASIC allow the use of translators for this purpose. On the IBM PC, Microsoft's Quick Basic, Borland's Turbo Basic, and Power Basic (an upgraded version of Turbo Basic distributed by Spectra Publishing) are widely used. In early 1999, Microsoft released a version of Visual Basic 6.0 (VB 6.0) for building rich software applications for enterprise systems. See [429] for more details.

- COBOL [COBOL - COmmon Business-Oriented Language] - A high-level programming language developed in the late 1950s. association CADASIL to solve commercial and economic problems. Differs in advanced means of working with files. Since the commands of programs written in this language make heavy use of ordinary English vocabulary and syntax, Cobol is regarded as one of the simplest programming languages. Currently used to solve economic, informational and other problems.

- Lisp [LISP - LISt Processing] - An algorithmic language developed in 1960 by J. McCarthy and designed to manipulate lists of data elements. Used primarily in US university laboratories to solve problems related to artificial intelligence. In Europe, for work on artificial intelligence, they prefer to use Prolog.

- LOGO [LOGO from Greek. logos - word ] - A high-level programming language developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology around 1970 for the purpose of teaching mathematical concepts. It is also used in schools and by PC users when writing programs for creating drawings on a monitor screen and controlling a pen plotter.

- Pascal [PASCAL - an acronym from French - Program Applique a la Selection et la Compilation Automatique de la Litterature] - A high-level procedurally oriented programming language developed in the late 1960s. Niklaus Wirth, originally to teach programming at universities. Named after the 17th century French mathematician Blaise Pascal. In its initial version, Pascal had rather limited capabilities, since it was intended for educational purposes, but its subsequent improvements made it a good universal language, widely used, among other things, for writing large and complex programs. There are a number of versions of the language (for example, ETH Pascal, USD Pascal, Turbo Pascal) and programming systems in this language for different types of computers. For the IBM PC, the most popular system is Turbo Pascal by Borland (USA). For more details on the Pskal languages ​​and their development see [653].

- Prolog [PROLOG - PROgramming in LOGic] - A high-level programming language of a declarative type (see declarative programming above), designed to develop artificial intelligence systems and programs. Belongs to the category of languages ​​​​of the fifth pok
