Relevance of the topic: An environmental problem is a change in the natural environment as a result of anthropogenic impacts or natural disasters, leading to a violation of the structure and functioning of nature.

Environmental problems arose as a result of the irrational attitude of man to nature, the rapid growth of industrial technologies, industrialization and population growth.

The development of natural resources is so great that the question arose about their use in the future. Pollution of the natural environment has led to the progressive death of representatives of the flora and fauna, pollution of soils, underground sources, depletion and degradation of the soil cover, etc.

The progress and fate of civilization depends on the solution of environmental problems, so the solution of environmental problems of the modern world is an important and urgent problem.

The purpose of the project: To study the environmental problems of our time.

Project objectives:

   - Tell about the causes of environmental problems in the world;
   - Consider the typology and classification of environmental problems;
   - Analysis of the main environmental problems;
   - Consider and identify the main ways to solve environmental problems.

Environmental problems of our time

Until the very last period of the Earth's history, the living systems of the planet evolved in almost complete harmony with the atmosphere, hydrosphere and lithosphere, without being influenced by human activity. But as agriculture and industry developed, human impact on the environment became more and more noticeable. Widespread industrialization, especially during the last two centuries, has led to potentially dangerous levels of pollution.

We can say that pollution is the entry into the environment of any substances or energy in such large quantities or for such a long time that these substances or energy begin to harm people and the environment. Easily spreading from one life-support component to another, pollution to one degree or another affects all environmental parameters - anthropogenic and natural, physical and biotic.
Air pollution


Back in the early sixties, it was believed that atmospheric pollution was a local problem of large cities and industrial centers, but later it became clear that atmospheric pollutants can spread through the air over long distances, having an adverse effect on areas located at a considerable distance from the place of emission of these substances.

Thus, air pollution is a global phenomenon and international cooperation is needed to control it. The most common atmospheric pollutants include gases such as chlorofluorocarbons, sulfur dioxide, hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen.

Pollution can lead to a significant decrease in the natural concentration of gases that make up the atmosphere, such as ozone in the stratosphere. In combination with hydrocarbons and compounds of the NOx group, ozone can be a direct hazard to human health, and is also one of the important constituents of photochemical smog.

Dust, noise, excessive heat, radiation and electromagnetic fields are all atmospheric pollution.
Ozone depletion

The earth's atmosphere consists mainly of nitrogen (about 78%) and oxygen (about 21%). A small part of oxygen is in the atmosphere in the form of ozone - oxygen molecules.

Ozone is concentrated mainly in the atmosphere at an altitude of 15-20 kilometers above the earth's surface. Despite the small amount, the role of ozone in the Earth's biosphere is extremely large and responsible. The ozonosphere absorbs a significant part of the hard ultraviolet radiation of the Sun, which is detrimental to living organisms.

She is a shield of life, but a shield regulated by nature. The ozonosphere transmits the longer-wavelength part of ultraviolet radiation. This penetrating part of ultraviolet radiation is necessary for life: it destroys pathogenic bacteria, promotes the production of vitamin D in the human body. The state of the ozone layer is extremely important, because even a slight change in the intensity of ultraviolet radiation near the earth's surface can affect living organisms

Causes of the thinning of the ozone layer:

   - During the launch of space rockets, holes are literally “burned out” in the ozone layer. And contrary to the old belief that they close immediately, these holes have been around for quite some time.
   - Aircraft flying at altitudes of 12-16 km. also harm the ozone layer, while flying below 12 km. on the contrary, they contribute to the formation of ozone.
   - Emission of freons into the atmosphere.

Chlorine and its hydrogen compounds are the main cause of the destruction of the ozone layer. A huge amount of chlorine enters the atmosphere, primarily from the decomposition of freons. Freons are gases that do not enter into any chemical reactions near the surface of the planet. Freons boil and quickly increase their volume at room temperature, and therefore are good atomizers.

Because of this feature, freons for a long time
